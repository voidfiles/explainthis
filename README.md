I am helping put together some demo/mock stuff for a site Jay Rosen has thought up

This is a mock-up for a news site that I think should exist: explainthis.org

Users go to the site and find a prompt similar to Twitter’s what’s happening? or Facebook’s what’s on your mind? But instead of updating their status they type in a question they have for a team of journalists who are… “standing by.”
